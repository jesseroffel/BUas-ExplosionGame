# BUas application Game: Explosion-Puzzle

To enter the Breda University of Applied Science I had to create a C++ game with the theme 'Explosion'. 

Using my limited game programming knowledge at the time I created a small game using third party libraries such as `OpenGL` and `SDL 2.0` to be able to create a small project which should have demonstrated my programming skills at the time.

[Simple Directmedia Layer 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/) For rendering, audio, input and data structures.



## Game mechanics

Within this game you control the placement of directional `X` and `Y` bombs which add velocity to the player character towards the goal. You complete a level by getting the ball towards the finish basked.

There are usually multiple solutions to finish the level.
This game contains 10 levels.
